# stripe-integration
In this project I have integrated the Stripe Checkout with a Node.js project. I have  used  Express, EJS and the official Stripe module to create a simple page with some products that will lead the buyer to the Stripe Checkout page and then complete the payment by passing the card details and shipping address.
